# The mandatory pre-push gate. Runs validate (fast quality gates) PLUS
# branch coverage on changed files PLUS mutation testing on changed
# tracked functions. The mutation gate is fast (sub-second) when no
# tracked function changed thanks to mutmut's function_hashes cache;
# slow (30+ min) only when tracked functions actually changed \u2014 exactly
# when you want the gate. CI does NOT run this.
pre-push-validate: validate validate-branch mutate-changed

# --- Mutation testing (mutmut) ---
# Local-only at pre-push (NOT in CI). Weekly CI mutation was removed in
# v1.4.0 because the same code was re-tested every week; pre-push with
# function_hashes cache is faster in the common case and only slow when
# the tracked function actually changed (which is the case you want
# the gate for). See mutation-testing skill in opencode-config.
#
# Why we mirror the full source tree to mutants/ before mutmut runs:
# mutmut only copies files listed in [tool.mutmut].source_paths into
# mutants/, then runs pytest in mutants/. If a test transitively
# imports a module NOT in source_paths (e.g. test_grid_generator.py
# imports from pocket_finder.py which isn't a mutated file), the
# import fails and pytest can't even COLLECT tests, let alone run
# them. We avoid that by pre-populating mutants/$(SRC) with the full
# source tree, then running mutmut on top. The mutated files overwrite
# the originals; the rest are unchanged. This is independent of what
# source_paths lists — mutmut still only mutates the source_paths files.
